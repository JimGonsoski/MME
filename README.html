</ol>

<h5>Upgrading from a prior version</h5>

<p>This version of MME makes several changes to database structures and is not backward-compatible with earlier database formats. During start-up the application checks to determine if the database is in the correct format and will not proceed with an earlier version. </p>

<p>Install the new version in a new location and then edit the new database as needed to provide the default values for your configuration. Look further on in this document for more detailed instructions on  user-configurable values in MME and how to set them.</p>

<h1>What it is</h1>

<p>The Minnesota Metadata Editor (MME) is a desktop application to create geospatial metadata files. </p>

<p>The program operates as a standalone application that allows you create, edit and display formatted metadata that adheres to the <a href="http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/committee/standards/mgmg/metadata.htm">Minnesota Geographic Metadata Guildelines (MGMG version 1.2)</a>, an implementation of the Federal Geographic Data Committee's (FGDC's) Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM).  </p>

<p>The MME is a customized version of the EPA Metadata Editor (EME) 3.1.1.  For more information on the EPA Metadata Editor, see <a href="https://edg.epa.gov/EME/">https://edg.epa.gov/EME/</a>. </p>

<h2>Get it</h2>

<p>Click the <strong>Download ZIP</strong> button in the lower right-hand corner to get a copy of the program. It might help to <a href="http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/chouse/mme/help">read the help</a>.</p>

<h2>Run it</h2>

<p>MME runs as portable application and needs no installation. Just unzip the contents of the application to any folder on your computer (We suggest <strong>Minnesota Metadata Editor</strong> as the folder name). Then open the folder and double-click <strong>MetadataEditor.exe</strong> to run the editor. </p>

<p>Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 must be installed on your machine.You can determine if the .NET Framework is on your machine by going to Start->Control Panel->Add or Remove Programs. 
You should see Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 listed.  Multiple versions of Microsoft .Net Framework (e.g., 1,2,3) may exist on your machine simultaneously. Microsoft's .NET Framework 3.5 is freely available and can be accessed from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=21">Microsoft's website</a>.</p>

<h2>Source</h2>

<p>The source for this application is available <a href="https://github.com/MetropolitanCouncil/MME-source">here</a>. It was last compiled with Visual Studio 2012 but should be reasonably compatible with Visual Studio 2010 if you create a new solution.</p>

<h2>Database</h2>

<p>The application is data-driven using a Microsoft Access database -- metadata.mdb -- stored in the application <strong>\portable</strong> folder. You may store some field values in this database to assign default values that apply to your particular agency or group. You need Microsoft Access in order to edit the database. Once edited, it can, however, be distributed to other machines that do not have Access installed. The application, itself, does not require Access installed on the local computer in order to run.</p>

<h3>Required User-configurable Database Values</h3>

<p>Contact information needs to be entered in the database table: <strong>Contact_Information</strong> in order for it to appear in your metadata files. You can store any number of contact names and addresses in the table. Within the application, the contact information will appear in the form of pull-down lists for each of these fields:</p>

<ul>
<li>data set contact Tab 1 </li>
<li>distribution contact Tab 3</li>
<li>metadata contact Tab 3</li>
</ul>
